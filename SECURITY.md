## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not file a public ticket** mentioning the vulnerability.

To find out how to disclose a vulnerability in Ethereum visit [https://bounty.ethereum.org](https://bounty.ethereum.org) or email bounty@ethereum.org. Please read the [disclosure page](https://github.com/ttt-verse/3t-chain/security/advisories) for more information about publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities.

Use the built-in `geth version-check` feature to check whether the software is affected by any known vulnerability. This command will fetch the latest [`vulnerabilities.json`](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/vulnerabilities/vulnerabilities.json) file which contains known security vulnerabilities concerning `geth`, and cross-check the data against its own version number.
